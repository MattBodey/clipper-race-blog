# Leg 5 race 6 

## Thursday 23rd

This leg started with a 150 mile motor through the great barrier reef along a route known as the hydrographers passage. After arriving at the planned start coordinates it was decided by the lead skipper for this start (Rob on Korea) that the wind was insufficient, so we motored over night and started the next morning at 7.00 local time. During the motor to the start I got the chance to go for a swim as we wanted to clean the bottom of the boat, so me and Ian took a side each. Surprisingly the bottom was virtually clean from any unwanted marine growths that would slow us down. Our first Le Mon start was OK. We over tightened our halyards on the initial hoist costing us a bit of time while we sorted them out. Then after the 10 minutes that we had to hold course where over we were the first boat to tack off the starting course. The light winds meant that everything was slow going but it is good to be racing again. Having the rest of the fleet around us still feels a little odd after doing 2 legs with virtually no boats in sight. The first day of racing involved a lot of tweaking to the boat trying to get the best possible speeds out of her and constantly wondering what the other boats were doing to achieve the extra knot that we didn't seem to have. As the wind died even more we switched to the wind seeker for a day and gradually closed with the rest of the fleet. Then yesterday morning we changed back to the yanky 1. The day was spent trying to get the most out of the extra breeze that the squally clouds produced. Below decks is a sauna during the day with the heat from the sun radiating down from the deck above. The nights provided a little restbite from the stifling heat. Just making it cool enough that you don't wake up dripping with sweat. 

## Sun 26th

Several days of frustrating light wind sailing along side WTC, Seattle and Korea brings us to the doldrums corridor and the Solomon sea. The sailing has been hard with each boat getting boosted by the fickle wind at differing times. And changing headings to suite at one point two of the boats were heading in the same direction on different tacks only 5 miles apart. The sea has been calm and the sun unrelenting making the deck almost to hot to touch at times. Yesterday we were the first boat to hoist our code 1 with Seattle and WTC quickly following suit. Its been interesting sailing this close to the other boats after two legs of isolation, seeing the different sail plans and how they effect the boats performance. As we had our y1 and stay up while Seattle had their wind seeker. Giving us the advantage in the stronger gusts and them the pace in the lulls. I have just finished my first mother watch of this leg with Sandra and now we are turning our engine on and starting our period of motoring. 36 hours with the hot and noisy engine on. 

## Monday 27th

Today we started a game of live Cluedo, we each selected at random from some bags a name, a location and a weapon. Our task to touch the person with the chosen weapon in the specified location. Once that has been achieved you collect their contract and they help you to complete it until there is one person left. This afternoon we have had 5 kills I think some competitively easy such as with a sharpy at the helming cage or a sponge by Ian's bunk., some not so like with a mattress in the cock pit. I have to get holly on the bow with a tin of chickpeas. We are motor-sailing now to try and get some extra speed, so we can track more west to hopefully put us in a better position for when our motoring period is up. Placing us in a stronger current and hopefully better winds. We wont know how successful our doldrums corridor has been until we leave the northern gate as we don't know if the other boats are motoring or sailing curently.

## Wed 29th

The last couple of days have been hard with variable winds from 0 to 10 knots requiring several sail changes. We have gotten very good at going from the wind seeker to the yanky 1 and stay sail then back to the wind seeker, with the occasional code 1 hoist and drop thrown in for good measure. When the wind has died off the decks have been getting so hot in the sun that its hard to touch at times. We have taken to opening the sail locker hatch to try and help cool the boat down. As we reach the end of the doldrums corridor the fleet has come back together with 5 boats constantly in sight despite the differing choices on when to motor.  Last night was particularly squally with big thunder storms all around. Mainly missing us although we did have one short down pour a welcome fresh water shower and a chance to cool down.  

## Friday 31st 

Yesterday we spent the morning sat in the wind shadow of an island along with 4 other boats finally escaping around lunch time. Since then we have been trying to hold our position with Quindao and Zhui sailing under y1 and in around 7 knots of wind. Its looking like we are going to have several more days of light winds before we finally pick up some stronger breeze. 

## Sunday 2nd

We crossed the equator at sunset on the 1st of February heading due north. To day we had a visit from Neptune for those of the crew that hadn't crossed the equator before. This time Danny took on the part and each person was covered in cold custard. We are now back in the northern hemisphere and will be for the rest of the race. Coinciding with this we have covered half the total miles for the round the world trip. We are continuing to battle our way north-west to enter the trade winds and finally leave the doldrums behind we have had around 10kn of wind over the last couple of days and have been tacking along as the wind shifts demand. 

## Monday 3rd

This morning we had to replace the pin in the shackle attaching the bob stay to the bow of the boat as it had fallen out during the night. We had to scavenge one of the shackles for the vang as we don't carry any spares of that size. Replacing the vang shackle with some dyneema and low friction rings. Not a permanent fix but much easer to replace and less catastrophic when it breaks than applying this method to the bob-stay.     

## Tuesday 4th 

Mothering comes round again. This time I'm paired with KC we had been expecting to be cooking with the boat at its max heal hoping to finally have made it into the strong trade winds. What we ended up with was a completely becalmed boat for most of the day.  Just after breakfast Ian dismantled the aft head pipe work as it was almost completely blocked by calcification. Causing the pump to back pressure. Then just as we where starting dinner we finally entered some wind accompanied by lots of rain and a sail change was required from the y1 to the y2 a bit of excitement to listen to while preparing a take on chilly con carny accompanied by some rice pudding and canned fruit. At least the rain had brought the temperature down from sweltering to hot. 

## Wednesday 5th

We had a busy morning watch, discovering that the salt water pump in the galley was leaking when we had to remove 20 plus buckets from the bilges. Then we changed the y2 to the y1. We managed to go from trimmed yanky to trimmed yanky in around 10 minutes. This is a key number as its the time that the boat is slow as you no longer have a head sail helping to drive you along. The other watch hoisted the code 3 during the afternoon. As the wind came round and we could bare away.

## Thursday 6th

During the night our course was decided by several shoals and reefs that we had to keep clear of restricting our heading. Just before sun rise we had to drop the code 3 so we could come up in to the wind enough to avoid the reef that was directly in our path. The drop went well then 2 hours later after it was packed we went to re-hoist it. This didn't go as smoothly for several reasons. During the drop we had managed to get one of the spinnaker halyards trapped between the yanky halyard and the stay. Meaning that rather then hoisting the code 3 before dropping the yanky to reduce the amount of time we didn't have a head sail up. We would have to drop the yanky first so we could untangle the line. The next thing that went wrong happened after we dropped the yanky. One of the spinnaker halyards got tangled around the top spreader and we where unable to flick if free. So we re-hoisted the yanky now untangled and I went up the mast to free the tangled line. Now we could finally hoist the code 3 before dropping the yanky for a 2nd time. It was looking like our troubles where over the hoist went well and the spinnaker inflated beautifully. When we went to drop the yanky it wouldnâ€™t come down. As the down haul was pinned to the top of the mast by the spinnaker halyards requiring us to untie the stopper knot in the cockpit so we could pull the line all the way through from the other end.  

## Saturday 8th

We have had several days of lovely spinnaker flying charging along at 11knots, having to keep our eyes out for squalls around sun rise and sun set. The ones we have encountered have only brought rain and not the sudden violent winds that would require us to drop the spinnaker for fear of damaging it. 

## Tuesday 11th

Since my last up date we have started and finished the ocean sprint and await the results. We had a fast couple of days under yanky 2 and reef 1 doing 12 kns average on a beam reach. Although we had several position updates where we where the fastest boat our course was less direct than some of the fleet so we are not expecting to do well. This morning we went back to the yanky 1 before hoisting the code 3 at the end of the watch as the winds have dropped and come round behind us.  We are heading directly for the mark at the top of Luzon. We are occasionally receiving up dates on the virus currently spreading through china and how that is impacting on the race, with Sanya removed from the stopover schedule and the rest of the Chinese stops up in the air all we know is that this race now finishes in Subic bay and that we should be in Seattle as planned.

## Wednesday 12th

We had a busy night last night as we passed the top of Luzon with a failed gybe leading to a small spinnaker rap around the forestay, resulting in us dropping the spinnaker straight onto the fore deck and changing to the yanky 1 sooner than planned. This all happened during my off watch. However I woke up at the start of the gybe and then when I herd that the spinnaker had rapped I got up to help. After everything was returned to normality we worked out that the reason it all went wrong was the lazy sheet had been rigged incorrectly and got jammed, as a result causing the spinnaker to get pinned half way through the manoeuvrer and then subsequently blown on to the forestay. Lessons have been re-learnt so hopefully we don't have the same issue again. After a night of good wind through the acceleration zone between the island and the main land we are now back to what feels like the standard sail configuration of wind seeker as we drift slowly down the cost in the wind shadow of Luzon 

## Saturday 15

we are continuing to make the best progress we can in the light fickle winds that we are being presented with this requires many sail changes from the yanky 1 to the wind seeker or the code 1 and back as the conditions dictate. The weather continues to be hot and sunny. We are seeing many local fishermen in there little out rigged boats offering us some of there catch when the pass looking on curiously. The waters along the coast of Luzon are busy with traffic big container ships small single person fishing boats and other fishing buoys.
