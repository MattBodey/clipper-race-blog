ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, it's great to have you here.

We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site with some initial __getting started__ posts that will help you get familiar with everything in no time. This is the first one!

## Next up, the editor
The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: the Ghost editor. This is where the good stuff happens.
> By the way, once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default __Ghost__ user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!
