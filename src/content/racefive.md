# Leg 4 race 5 Fremantle to Airlie beach Whitsundays

## 26th December

After a short whirlwind stopover in Fremantle we are back on the high seas. This time heading south around the bottom of Tasmainia and then up the east cost of Australia a trip of around 3500 miles. Leaving day felt very rushed and at some point during the day I managed to lose my glasses not ideal in normal circumstances. Thankfully I have some contacts with me to see me till the end of the leg. The start of the race was uneventful. We postponed Christmas by a day as we where beating up wind and had the boat on its side, not great conditions for present opening. Today the wind has decreased and came round behind us making the boat much flatter, allowing us to hoist our spinnakers first the C1 then just after our Christmas dinner we changed to the C2. As mother with Dermot we where tasked with cooking our meal of roast potatoes and carrots served alongside cocktail sausages and sliced turkey breast. Before serving Christmas podding for desert. Big thank you to everyone for the presents and cards this has defiantly been one of the more unusual  Christmas I have had.


## Sat 28th

Yesterday just before dinner I passed out from dehydration because I forgot to drink anything all afternoon. An incredibility silly thing to do. It wasn't even a busy watch just never found the time to fill my bottle. During the night watch at about 0200 the code 3 decided to decapitate its self leaving its head at the top of the mast and dumping the body into the sea. Everyone was woken up to help pull the sail back on board and down below. So we could hoist the Y1 and get moving again albeit at a slightly slower pace. There is only 15 crew this leg making the boat feel empty compared to previous legs when we have had 22 crew. I am noticing the lower numbers on deck as there is often only 3 of us when others are doing the daily jobs. This makes manoeuvrers slightly more complex as each person has to fill multiple roles. We are coping incredibly well with this partly due to the knowledge, experience and enthusiasm that the new members have brought to the table. I feel that we are gelling was a crew very quickly, as things are done from understanding rather than because they are told step by step how do do a task.

## Sun 29th

During the night watches we had a couple of sail changes, my watch hoisted the C2 just after dinner. Then the other watch dropped it around midnight as the wind had increased. This morning saw us with the Y1 and stay sail which was dropped as the wind continued to build sitting around 20knots for the remainder of the watch. Everyone seams to have recovered from there initial sea sickness, the down wind sailing may have helped with that. 

## Mon 30th

Yesterday afternoon the other watch changed the Y1 to the Y2 and put in reef 2 as the wind had built to 30knots and squalls where expected brining an increase wind with them. The night watches saw us dealing with up to 40knots of wind and confused rough sea state making helming a challenge, the stars were out to give some guidance. Me and Danny shared the helm skimming down the waves. The sunrise brought a slight decrease in wind speed as we shook out both reefs, it also shifted 40deg to the north making our sailing angle worse but not coming round far enough to make the other gybe more favourable. 

## Wednesday 1st

Tuesday afternoon we had a fantastic watch flying down the swell continually tying to get the fastest and longest surfs with the aim of getting above 20knots. As the sun set the other watch put in reef one as the wind started to build. When we came on for the midnight watch new years arrival was overshadowed by the need to put in reef 2 as the wind continued to increase maxing out at 40knots in some of the gusts. We had to cut one of the lines we had rigged on the main sail that aid with pulling it down for reefing as it was to long and had got hooked round the front of the mast preventing us from dropping the sail for the reef. The night was an incredibly dark one with just blackness in front making it hard to see even the bow of the boat at times. With the instruments turned off as they are to bright helming was done bye the feel of the boat and the wind on your ear. Slightly unnerving when you first take over. This morning the wind dropped off and we shook out reef 1. Reef 2 having been taken out by the other watch. Then just before the lunchtime meeting we did our first white sail change as a watch changing from the Y2 to the Y1. The lunchtime meeting was a bit different for new year with new years resolutions being read out and us playing guess who. 

## Thursday 2nd 

The first watch of the night was an uneventful one. The sunrise one ended in a rush with the decision to hoist the code 2 taken after sunrise as the wind had dropped down to around 15knots. As we set about getting ready for the hoist I checked my watch and see I have 30mins till I need to go down into the galley to start breakfast, plenty of time for a sail change. We get everything ready no problem. Then it all goes wrong the code 2 pops open half way through the hoist, then while it was hidden behind the yanky it hour glasses. We get the yanky down fine and look up to find the spinnaker rapped around its self. After a couple of unsuccessful attempts at getting it to untwist we have to drop it and start again. So down it comes, thankfully without indecent and undamaged. Now we have to hoist the Y1 to maintain some semblance of speed while the code 2 is unwrapped and repacked. A quick look at my watch and its 6.15, breakfast is going to be late. Thankfully Danny had woken the other mother up just before we dropped the spinnaker so the other watch where up and ready as normal. At lunch time I found out that they had had a similar problem during their hoist if the sail although they managed to get the twists out without having to drop and repack almost dropping it in the sea in the process. 

## Saturday 4th 

Yesterday we saw land for the first time since leaving Fremantle marking our turn north as we left the southern ocean end entered the east Tasmainia sea. 

We are just about to start our ocean sprint for this leg and we are hopeful of doing well as it looks like the wind is in our favour. This afternoons watch was a busy one starting with a couple of hours of light up wind sailing in poor visibility before the wind shifted round to the south and increased from 10 to 30 knots. We put a reef in during the initial burst then decided that we would be ok without it so shook it back out. Then just before the end of the watch we gybed to stay in the faverable current.

## Sunday 5th 

This moring the code 2 was hoisted by the other watch just before breakfast, giving us a lovely down wind morning. The sky are very grey currently with a slight yellow tinge to the clouds, a product of the fires raging in land we believe.



## Tuesday 7th

As we finished the ocean sprint the wind shifted round to the east so we dropped the spinnaker, came up on the wind to maintain our northerly heading and stick with the favourable current. This should help boost us up the coast. We are hoping we will get second in the sprint. The last couple of days have been grey partially due to the fires in shore. As we continue to head north the temperature is gradually rising, our cold weather kit is getting packed back into bags. 

## Thursday 9th

Iâ€™m back on mother duties today and its hot and sweaty in the galley as we are currently in the transition area before the trade winds kick in. This means its hot and sunny on deck with light winds. Yesterday we spent 10 hours drifting with the current before the wind came back over night. At least we had a favourable current. Some of the fleet have taken the inshore option which is shorter, but puts them against the fast flowing east Australia current. Punching into 4plus knots of current in light winds is slow going according to the position updates, allowing us to over take despite the extra miles. The wind angles effectively pin them in to the cost, as to come off shore they would have to travel south east making there trip even longer. 

## Saturday 11th

Champaign sailing best describes the last couple of days, blue sky's and flat seas. We are now in the trade winds and have entered the corridor between the barrier reef and the main land. With 12knots of breeze and the code 1 up we have been making good progress chasing down Vietnam, who finished first on the course but, as we left 48h after them we have window of opportunity to get the top stop.

We had an unexpected passenger last night as a red footed booby decided to use our stern railing as a roost completely unperturbed by us on the helm.

## Sunday 12th 

Light winds have meant that our progress has drastically slowed and we are now no longer in contention for first or second. Third is still achievable with the current forecast. Most of the talk on board over the past 24hours has been on what average speeds we need to be getting to get each position. The speculation got so obsessive that we had to ban all talk on the subject during the afternoon watch. 
We have been gybing through the course gates along the reef and changed from the code 1 to the 2 as the wind increased. 
Punta passed us this afternoon under motor their race over they accepted 10th place yesterday and are now making best speed for the finish along with Sanya who took 11th.
